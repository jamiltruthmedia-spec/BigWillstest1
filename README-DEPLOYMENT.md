# Big Will's Kitchen - Fixed File Structure

## ✅ **Problem Fixed!**

The website now works with the flat file structure you created. Here's what I fixed:

### **File Structure (Current)**
```
Big Wills Kitchen/
├── index.html              # Main homepage
├── style.css               # Main stylesheet (moved from assets/css/)
├── js/
│   └── script.js          # JavaScript (moved from assets/js/)
├── images/                 # Images folder
│   ├── placeholder.txt
│   └── README.md
├── vercel.json            # Updated for flat structure
├── package.json
├── sitemap.xml
├── robots.txt
└── business-data/         # Private folder (excluded from Git)
```

### **What I Fixed:**

1. **CSS Path:** Changed from `assets/css/style.css` to `style.css`
2. **JS Path:** Changed from `assets/js/script.js` to `js/script.js`
3. **Image Paths:** Changed from `assets/images/` to `images/`
4. **Vercel Config:** Updated to work with flat structure
5. **All file references:** Updated to match new structure

### **Files Updated:**
- ✅ `index.html` - Fixed all asset paths
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Updated for flat structure
- ✅ `test-css.html` - Created test page

### **How to Test:**

1. **Local Test:**
   - Open `test-css.html` in browser
   - If you see styled elements, CSS is working!

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Push to GitHub
   - Vercel will auto-deploy
   - Website should work perfectly

### **Why This Structure Works Better:**

1. **Vercel Friendly:** No nested folders causing issues
2. **Simple Paths:** Direct file references
3. **Fast Loading:** No complex routing
4. **Easy Maintenance:** All files in root level

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Add Images:** Put your photos in `images/` folder
2. **Deploy:** Push to GitHub and Vercel
3. **Test:** Check that everything loads correctly

### **Image Files Needed:**
- `images/hero-cheesesteak.jpg`
- `images/bodega-exterior.jpg`
- `images/food-truck.jpg`
- `images/restaurant-interior.jpg`

**The website should now work perfectly with Vercel!**
